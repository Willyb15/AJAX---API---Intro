README-Yahoo Finance API
======
**Yahoo Finance API Web Application** is a practice with API's and the .getJSON method in jQuery. Created a table using basic HTML, then used jQuery and Yahoo Finance API to upload data into the table. Also, have used the jQuery plugin "Footables" to style the table and add sorting techniques.
